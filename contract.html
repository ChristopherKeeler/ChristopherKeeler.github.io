  <h1>Course Contract Agreement</h1>

  <p>
    I, <strong>Christopher A. Keeler</strong>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my 
    <strong>Spring 2025</strong>, <strong>ITSC1110</strong>, <strong>Introduction to Computing</strong> class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
  </p>

  <p>
    I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
    and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
    As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples 
    online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to learn, and will not 
    cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
  </p>
